      <h1>Setting Up Dependencies to Clojure</h1>
      <p>Creating a Clojure project or adding Clojure support to an existing
      Java project will automatically add a dependency to the Clojure Plugin's
      own embedded versions of Clojure and clojure-contrib, if the Clojure JAR
      file is not found in the classpath.</p>
      <p>Clojure itself must always be a dependency of the project, but this is
      highly customizable. It can come in as many flavors as Eclipse allows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Clojure source code directly embedded in the project (not recommended)</li>
        <li>As another project in the Eclipse workspace. You then make the Clojure
        project a dependency of your own project (recommended if you want to stay in
        sync with Clojure's development):
            <ul>
                <li>First create a classic java project for the source code of
                Clojure. You will have to change the default Java source folder:
                You must have two of them, one will be src/jvm, the other will be src/clj.</li>
                <li>In a second project where you enabled Clojure support, do
                <strong>Project &gt; Properties &gt; Java Build Path &gt; Projects &gt; Add</strong> and add the Clojure project.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>As a JAR file. Use the classical Java mechanism offered by
        Eclipse to add the JAR file to your project (<strong>Project &gt; Properties &gt; Java
        build path &gt; Libraries ...</strong>).</li>
        </ul>
   </body>

<h1>Create Labrepl Project Wizard</h1>
<h2>About This Wizard</h2>
<p>When the optional <b>Counterclockwise Examples Plug-In</b> is
installed, it contains a full copy of "labrepl for Clojure". The <a
	href="http://github.com/relevance/labrepl">original labrepl for
Clojure</a> is maintained on <a href="http://github.com">github</a>. Its <a
	href="http://github.com/relevance/labrepl/blob/master/README.markdown">README
file</a> contains an overview of the features of labrepl.</p>

contains the labrepl code. Optionally it is possible to
automatically download its dependencies from the <a

<h2>Using the Create Labrepl Project Wizard</h2>
<p>
To open the <b>New Example</b> wizard in the workbench, use <b>File &gt; New &gt; Example...</b>. Then
select <b>Create Labrepl Project</b> from the <b>Counterclockwise Examples</b>
category.

		Disclaimer: The Counterclockwise Plug-in does not have any control about what exactly will be downloaded from Clojars.
		What will be downloaded is a consequence of the dependency information stored

		If unsure about this,
		please uncheck this option and review the dependencies in the <b>project.clj</b> file after
		the labrepl project has been created in the workspace.<br>
		An active Internet connection is required for downloading the dependencies. This can

<h2>Manual Steps</h2>
<h3>Running <b>lein deps</b> Manually</h3>
If you did choose not to run <b>lein deps</b> automatically from the wizard,
you will need to run it manually, and it is necessary to have a full copy of the
<a href="http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen">Leiningen</a> build tool installed. It is currently
not possible to run <b>lein deps</b> explicitly from the Eclipse workbench with the Leiningen tool that is built
into the <b>Counterclockwise Examples Plug-In</b>. You need to open a command prompt in the root directory of the labrepl project
that was created by the wizard, and run <b>lein deps</b> from the command prompt.
<h3>Starting the labrepl Session Manually</h3>
If you did choose not to start a REPL for the labrepl tutorial automatically from the wizard, or
if you want to start the labrepl tutorial another time after it had been set up by the wizard,
right-click on the <b>labrepl.clj</b> file in the <b>src</b> folder of the labrepl project that was created by the
 wizard, and select <b>Run As &gt; Clojure REPL</b>. In the console view that is opened
type <b>(labrepl/-main)</b> and hit &lt;ENTER&gt;. Browse to <a href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a>
to view the labrepl tutorial web pages.
<h2>Known Issues</h2>
The Create Labrepl Project wizard is currently considered beta. The following known
issues exist:
<ul>
<li>No user feedback after <b>lein deps</b> is finished until the REPL is started:<br>
If the option <b>Run "lein deps" to download dependencies</b> is switched on, the wizard
dialog will show progress messages about the dependencies that are downloaded. If the
option <b>Run REPL and open tutorial web page</b> is also switched on, there will be
a delay until the REPL console view and the corresponding web browser is opened. During the
delay there is no feedback to the user that something is still happening.
</li>
<li>Error message <b>java.lang.Exception: Unmatched delimiter: )</b>:<br>
After the labrepl tutorial was started in the REPL console, an error message
 <b>java.lang.Exception: Unmatched delimiter: )</b> appears. This can be safely ignored.</li>
 <li>labrepl tutorial does not start:<br>
 It sporadically happens that the labrepl tutorial session does not start in the
 REPL console after the creation of the labrepl project and after the download of the dependencies.
Also the browser for the tutorial web pages does not open. In that case kill the running
REPL in the REPL console view and delete the labrepl project that was just created. Then
re-run the <b>Create Labrepl Project</b> wizard. Normally the wizard will run successfully the
second time.</li>
</ul>

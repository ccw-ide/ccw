If you discover issues, have ideas for improvements or new features, please report them to the
https://github.com/laurentpetit/ccw/issues[issue tracker] of the repository or submit a pull request. Please,
try to follow these guidelines when you do so.

== Issue reporting

- Check that the issue has not already been reported.
- Check that the issue has not already been fixed in the latest code
  (a.k.a. `master`).
- Be clear, concise and precise in your description of the problem.
- Open an issue with a descriptive title and a summary in grammatically correct,
  complete sentences.
- Include any relevant code to the issue summary, try to reproduce the problem using SWTBot (menu:Clojure[Test > Generator...]) and paste its generated code (<<swtbot-tests,see also here>>).
- Follow the Angular JS commit convention https://gist.github.com/stephenparish/9941e89d80e2bc58a153 . We are little bit liberal with the conventions, take inspiration from the CCW commits history to find a good mesure

== Pull Requests

- Discuss the Pull Request on the mailing list to maximize the chances it will be accepted
- Read http://gun.io/blog/how-to-github-fork-branch-and-pull-request[how to properly contribute to open source projects on Github]
- Centralize the collected knowledge in a new issue in the https://github.com/laurentpetit/ccw/issues[issue tracker]. Mention the created issue on the mailing list thread.
- Open a https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests[pull request] that relates to *only* one subject with a clear title and description in grammatically correct, complete sentences.
- Create and Use a topic branch off of the master branch to easily amend the pull request later, if necessary. It is OK to rebase the topic branch on top of the master branch.
- Respect a 1-1 relation between Topic Branches and Pull Requests.
- During the review/adapt phase for the Pull Request, append commits to the topic branch, don't rewrite the history. This will make Reviewers life easier.
- Once the Pull Request is Reviewed and Accepted, it is OK to squash related commits together before merging, if necessary.

== Developing within Eclipse

=== Prerequisites

- Java 7
- Maven >= 3.1.1
** download from http://mirrors.linsrv.net/apache/maven/maven-3/3.1.1/binaries/apache-maven-3.1.1-bin.zip
** unzip somewhere, e.g. `/path/to/maven`, create an environment variable `M2_HOME=/path/to/maven`, add `$M2_HOME/bin` to your path
- `Eclipse IDE for Java and DSL Developers` Luna sr1 (4.4.1) https://eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-and-dsl-developers/lunasr1
** This packaging is preferred because it's the one embedding the more eclipse source code packages out of the box (see https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/compare.php?release=luna )


=== Install & Configure

WARNING: The Git repository contains submodules in `ccw.core/ccw-plugins/`. you must clone with the `--recursive` option

- Clone CCW Repository `with the --recursive option` (this is a submodule option, see references below for more on submodules)
** https://github.com/laurentpetit/ccw
- In Eclipse, import the repository projects (`ccw.aggregator`, `ccw.branding`, `ccw.core`, `ccw.core.test`, `ccw.feature`, `ccw.parent`, `ccw.product`, `doc`, `paredit.clj`)
- cd into `ccw.core` and invoke `mvn clean verify`
** This will install all CCW dependencies in folder `ccw.core/lib/`
** The operation must be be repeated after each update of `ccw.core` dependencies

=== Run a Test CCW environment

The following launch configuration files automatically install themselves in the "Run/Debug" Toolbar items as Shortcuts:

- `Counterclockwise Plugin` for Debugging the Plugin by launching it in the current PDE Target (shortcut for `ccw.core/Counterclockwise Plugin.launch`)
- `Counterclockwise Product` for Debugging the Standalone Product (shortcut for `ccw.core/Counterclockwise Product.launch`)
- `Counterclockwise Product Tests` for Launching the JUnit tests (some tests don't pass in this mode) (shortcut for `ccw.core.test/Counterclockwise Product Tests.launch`)
- `Counterclockwise SWTBot Tests` for Launching SWTBot tests (shortcut for `ccw.core.test/Counterclockwise SWTBot Tests.launch`)

== From the Command Line

=== Compile / Test / Package

----
git clone https://github.com/laurentpetit/ccw
cd ccw

# Clean + compile + unit test + integration test + build updatesite
# + build Windows / Linux / OS X standalone products + build documentation:
mvn clean verify

# Compile + tests but no product(s) built (less time to complete):
# This deactivates the `luna` profile which deactivates the `ccw.product` module
mvn verify -P \!luna

# Same as above, but skipping launching tests:
mvn clean verify -DskipTests

# To only launch tests
mvn clean test
----

The products will be available in folder `ccw.product/target/products`

== Manage Version Numbers

The script `script/set-version.sh` updates `POMs`, `MANIFESTs` and `feature.xml` :

----
# If you want to set version to 0.20.0-SNAPSHOT
$ cd ccw
ccw$ script/set-version.sh 0.20.0-SNAPSHOT
----

== Adding clojure.test based tests

- Add the test namespace in `ccw.core.test/src/clj` using the usual namespace structure for folders
- Add the namespace to the list of namespaces to be tested in the java file `ccw.core.test/src/java/ccw/core/ClojureTests.java`

[[swtbot-tests]]
== Adding SWTBot tests

- Open the SWTBot menu (menu:Clojure[Test > Generator...]) and press btn:[Start Recording].
- Execute the UI action(s) that are necessary to perform the test you have in mind (you will see SWTBot generating code while you proceed).
- Adapt the test to the existing code. Exploring the `BotUtils` might bring forth some reusable code, see https://wiki.eclipse.org/SWTBot/Generator#Limitations[this doc] for why you need this.
- Add you code to `ccw.core.test/src/java` and commit using `test`.

== Make CCW depend on a new feature

- Add the new feature dependency to the product definition in file `ccw.product/ccw.product`. See https://github.com/laurentpetit/ccw/blob/v0.31.1.STABLE001/ccw.product/ccw.product#L270
- If the new feature is not already provided by the p2 repositories known to the build, you'll need to add its repository to file `ccw.parent/pom.xml`. See https://github.com/laurentpetit/ccw/blob/v0.31.1.STABLE001/ccw.parent/pom.xml#L63


== Version Release Checklist

- Determine the new version number
- Update the Changelog note
- Mark the issues as Fixed

----

- Drop an email to users and dev list
- Twit about it (mention #Counterclockwise and #Clojure)

----
    # Edit Changelog then...
    ./script/set-number 3.4.10-SNAPSHOT
    git commit -a -m"chore(mvn): Upgrade version to 3.4.10-SNAPSHOT"
----

== How To ...

=== Add a new user plugin as a submodule

- First clone the plugin as a submodule in the right directory
----
    cd ccw.core/ccw-plugins/
    git submodule add https://github.com/ccw-ide/ccw-plugin-xxx.git
----
- Then open `ccw.core/plugin.xml` in Eclipse
** In the `Runtime` Tab, add `ccw-plugins/ccw-plugin-xxx` to the classpath
** In the `Build` Tab, in the `Binary Build` group, ensure that `ccw-plugins/ccw-plugin-xxx` is checked (everything inside `ccw-plugins` should be checked)
